Hi&#10069 Do you know where Helios is coming from&#10068 Well &#8230;<br><br><br><br>

&#8618; Helios was the personification of the Sun in Greek mythology. According to Hesiod, he is the son of the Titan Hyperion and the Titaness Theia.
He is the of the goddesses Selene, the moon, and Eos, the dawn.<br><br>
&#8227; Helios was described as a handsome titan crowned with the shining aureole of the Sun, who drove the chariot of the sun across the sky each day
to earth-circling Oceanus and through the world-ocean returned to the East at night. The horses were given fiery names: Pyrois, Aeos, Aethon, and Phlegon.<br><br>
&#8226; As time passed, Helios was increasingly identified with the god of light, Apollo. However, in spite of their syncretism, 
they were also often viewed as two distinct gods/titan (Helios was a Titan, whereas Apollo was an Olympian).
